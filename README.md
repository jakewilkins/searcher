This is finding me a motorcycle, and also some outdoor furniture.

It needs a few envs: `MAILGUN_API_KEY, MAILGUN_DOMAIN, DATABASE_URL,` & `NOTIFIER_FROM`

It needs a postgres running.

I'm running this on a Raspberry PI in my house, I tried running it on Digital Ocean
but I think this site has Digital Ocean rate-limited, because I was watching HTML
download line-by-line.
